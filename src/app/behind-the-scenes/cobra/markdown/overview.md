# COBRA Overview

## Problem Statement

As we can probably gather, the federal budget is tight in some areas and generous in others. For the under-equipped agencies, navigating court cases can be a nightmare because well-funded litigation opponents can win a war of attrition with their vast legal departments. In many cases, defendants will settle early when they cannot fund lengthy trials. Through out this process, legal parties can hire hundreds of contractors, subject matter experts, and paralegals to read millions of documents to determine whether they have enough data to proceed with a case, and this costs a lot of money.

In response COBRA is an e-discovery platform designed to reduce the amount of human labor required to sift through documents for responsive evidence. Users can leverage machine learning to filter out duplicate and near-duplicate data, and case managers can harness the power of search engines to filter documents and assign document collections to various teams. Additionally case managers can drill down various graphs to get a better idea of the performance of machine learning algorithms.

## Features

COBRA has some cool features such as

- Comprehensive document tagging interface
- Email thread resolution
- Named-entity recognition
- Document recombination
- Human-in-the-loop document classification
- Duplicate and near-duplicate document elimination
